      <h1>History of Blood Banking</h1>
      <div class="" name="bloodletting">
        <h2>Bloodletting</h2>
        <p>Bloodletting was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and
          other bodily fluid were considered to be "humors,"
          the proper balance of which maintained health.</p>
        <div class="isi">
          <h4>c. 2500 BCE: Egyptians Use Bleeding</h4>
          <p>A tomb illustration in Memphis, Egypt, depicts a patient being bled from the foot and neck.
            Though the bloodletting was often recommended by physicians it was carried out by barbers,
            eventually symbolized by the red-and-white-striped barber pole.</p>

        <div class="isi">
          <h4>1897: Dracula by Irish Author Bram Stoker is Published</h4>
          <p>Remembered as the quintessential vampire novel, it provided the basis of modern vampire fiction…
            the taking of blood from the living to sustain the "life" of the undead.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="isi">
          <h4>Late 1800s: Bloodletting Medically Questioned</h4>
          <p>The benefits of bloodletting began to be seriously questioned in the second half of the 1800s.
            Some still considered it beneficial in some circumstances, for instance to "clear out" infected
             or weakened blood or to stop hemorrhaging.
            Some forms of bloodletting persisted into the 20th century.</p>

      <div class="" name="transfusion">
        <h2>Transfusions</h2>
        <div class="isi">
          <h4>1492: First Historical Transfusion Attempt</h4>
          <p>The blood of three 10-year-old boys was infused by mouth into Pope Innocent VIII as he sank into a coma.
            The Pope and the boys died.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="isi">
          <h4>1667: First Recorded Human Transfusion</h4>
          <p>The first fully documented human blood transfusion was administered in France.
            King Louis XIV's doctor transfused the blood of a sheep into a 15-year-old boy, who survived. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="isi">
          <h4>1818: First Recorded Human-to-Human Transfusion</h4>
          <p>British obstetrician and physiologist James Blundell performs the first recorded human-to-human blood transfusion.
            He injected a patient suffering from internal bleeding with 12 to 14 ounces of blood from several donors.
            The patient died after initially showing improvement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="isi">
          <h4>1901: Three Main Blood Groups Discovered</h4>
          <p>Discovery of the three main human blood groups, A, B, and C, which is later changed to O.
            Research charts the regular pattern of reaction that occurs after mingling the serum and red cells of an initial set of six blood specimens. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="isi">

        <div class="isi">
          <h4>1914: First Non-Direct Transfusion</h4>
          <p>The first transfusions had to be made directly from donor to receiver before coagulation.
            Researchers discover that adding sodium citrate to blood will prevent it from clotting.
            Adding anticoagulant and refrigerating the blood made it possible to store it for days, opening the way for blood banking.</p>

        <div class="isi">
          <h4>1917: First Blood Depot</h4>

          <p>The discovery that slowly thawed frozen plasma yields deposits high in Factor VIII.
            These deposits, called cryoprecipitates - or cryo - are found to have much greater clotting
            power than plasma and are given to hemophiliacs to stop bleeding episodes.</p>
