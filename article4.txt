Studies generally affirm the impact of socioeconomic status (as measured by education level or individual income) in affecting blood donation practices, although the exact relationships are unclear a priori. For instance, Cimaroli (2012) finds that highly educated populations are less likely to donate blood frequently. Similarly, Saberton et al. (2009) point to the inverse relationship between average household income and donor numbers in large cities. In contrast, Veldhuizen et al. (2009) and Carrier, Cloutier and Charbonneau (2015) note that one of the primary characteristics of blood donors is the better than average education. Meanwhile, findings by Burgdorf et al. (2017) suggest individuals within higher income brackets form the majority of the blood donor population, while Veldhuizen et al. (2009) and Carrier, Cloutier and Charbonneau (2015) conclude that nonremunerated blood donation is typically associated with those in the affluent social class. Possible rationalisations for these outcomes vary. It is possible that time constraints of a demanding lifestyle among better educated individuals may hinder donation frequencies. Likewise, persons with higher income levels may also face higher time costs, thus dampening their donation likelihoods. However, better educated individuals may also be more conscious of the vital role of blood donation while individual affluence may contribute to greater access to health information. Based on these outcomes, no hypothesised relationships are posited for the socioeconomic variables of education and income in the present study.
