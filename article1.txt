Studies have examined blood donation patterns and its association with sociodemographic and lifestyle-behavioural characteristics. For example, Cimaroli(2012) notes that families with more children at home exhibit lower likelihoods of multiple blood donations annually while singles are positively associated with donation frequency. This could be attributed to the busy schedules and priorities of families with more children whereas singles face less time constraints. According to Dilsad et al. (2014), individuals may forgo blood donation due to responsibilities in caring for family or if there is nobody to mind their children. This follows the findings of Carrier, Cloutier and Charbonneau (2015) that while family relationship is a primary motivator for parents to donate blood, the preferred timing is when their children are not around. From these outcomes, it is hypothesised that number of children will be inversely related with donation status in the current study.
