Studies have examined blood donation patterns and its association with sociodemographic and lifestyle-behavioural characteristics. For example, Cimaroli(2012) notes that families with more children at home exhibit lower likelihoods of multiple blood donations annually while singles are positively associated with donation frequency. This could be attributed to the busy schedules and priorities of families with more children whereas singles face less time constraints. According to Dilsad et al. (2014), individuals may forgo blood donation due to responsibilities in caring for family or if there is nobody to mind their children. This follows the findings of Carrier, Cloutier and Charbonneau (2015) that while family relationship is a primary motivator for parents to donate blood, the preferred timing is when their children are not around. From these outcomes, it is hypothesised that number of children will be inversely related with donation status in the current study.

Hollingsworth and Wildman (2004) and Burgdorf et al. (2017) find that time constraints due to a busy working schedule and a changing structure of society may constrain blood donation likelihoods. Meanwhile, Kasraian (2010) indicates that the most frequent reason for lapsed donation is a lack of time due to work. As noted by Guest, Munro, and Cookson (1998), the annual costs of blood transfusions can be significant as aside from direct costs (e.g. hospital resources, transport, etc.), donors incur indirect costs due to lost productivity (e.g. sick/annual leave, absence from work, etc.), while giving up leisure time in the donation process. These findings suggest that length of work hours may be negatively associated with blood donation status as those who are busier will have less time to donate. Moreover, within the subgroups of occasional and regular donors, a higher likelihood would be expected within the former than the latter as busy people are more likely to lapse in their donation regularity.
