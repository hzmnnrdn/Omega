As suggested by Piliavin and Callero (1991), and Glynn et al. (2006), the role of life experience (e.g. knowing a family member/friend who needs blood transfusion) is positively associated with blood donation decisions. Healy (2000) attributes this outcome to "network effects", whereby being associated with family/ friends with blood needs result in higher donation probabilities by one's own self. Two possible explanations are offered. First, individuals with family members/ friends requiring emergency blood/organ transfusion may have better knowledge and familiarity with the donation process. Second, individuals with life experience for the need of a valuable resource such as blood are better able to empathise with the situation and would thus be more likely to donate to others in return. Therefore, a positive association is expected between blood donation status and those with family members/friends who received blood/organ transfusion in the past.

Studies have shown that hemophobia (fear of blood), trypanophobia (fear of needles), and even the general fear of the entire donation process are valid concerns that may discourage blood donations. Marantidou et al. (2007) assert that among the predominant reasons for not returning to donate is due to the fear of needles/pain/fainting during the collection process. Meanwhile, Hupfer, Taylor, and Letwin (2005) allude to the negative factors of the sight of blood and apprehension of the overall blood procurement process as reasons for avoiding donation. As such, it is hypothesised that a general fear of the donation process would have a negative effect on blood donation status.
