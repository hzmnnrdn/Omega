Studies on the role of age on blood donor patterns have generally shown mixed outcomes. For instance, Marantidou et al. (2007) note that young people are less likely to donate in Greece, while Kasraian (2010), Volken et al. (2013), and Ou et al. (2015) report higher response rates among older donors in Iran, Germany, and Hong Kong, respectively. Meanwhile, Boulware et al. (2002), Wiwanitkit (2002), and Shenga et al. (2010) find no discerning association between age and knowledge or actual blood donation in U.S., Thailand, and India, respectively. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note the findings of Wooi Seong (2017) that the majority of blood donors in Malaysia are predominantly from the younger age group of 17–35 years. Given the overall mixed outcomes, the association between age and blood donor patterns will be further ascertained, albeit with close attention on the contribution of the younger donors.

The role of marital status on blood donation decisions is inconclusive. For example, Gillespie and Hillyer (2002) and Veldhuizen et al. (2009) conclude that blood donation is most common among married people. Mesch et al. (2011) attribute this outcome to the better social network connectivity enjoyed by married persons that motivate their donation behaviour to do good to others. Interestingly, Burgdorf et al. (2017) stress that while blood donation status is strongly linked with cohabitation status among Danish men, the effects are less clear for women. In other words, being married serves as a strong positive predictor of blood donation only among men, while the association is not as evident for women. Meanwhile, Kasraian (2010) and Shenga et al. (2010) find no significant relationship between blood donation knowledge and marital status. Thus, the role of marital status on blood donation status will be further examined in the current study.
