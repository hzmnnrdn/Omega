      <h1>Research</h1>

        <p>Studies have examined blood donation patterns and its association with sociodemographic and lifestyle-behavioural characteristics.
           For example, Cimaroli(2012) notes that families with more children at home exhibit lower likelihoods of multiple blood donations annually while singles are positively associated with donation frequency.
           This could be attributed to the busy schedules and priorities of families with more children whereas singles face less time constraints.
           According to Dilsad et al. (2014), individuals may forgo blood donation due to responsibilities in caring for family or if there is nobody to mind their children.
           This follows the findings of Carrier, Cloutier and Charbonneau (2015) that while family relationship is a primary motivator for parents to donate blood, the preferred timing is when their children are not around.
           From these outcomes, it is hypothesised that number of children will be inversely related with donation status in the current study.</p>

          <p>Hollingsworth and Wildman (2004) and Burgdorf et al. (2017) find that
             time constraints due to a busy working schedule and a changing structure of
             society may constrain blood donation likelihoods. Meanwhile, Kasraian (2010)
             indicates that the most frequent reason for lapsed donation is a lack of time due to
             work. As noted by Guest, Munro, and Cookson (1998), the annual costs of blood
             transfusions can be significant as aside from direct costs (e.g. hospital resources,
             transport, etc.), donors incur indirect costs due to lost productivity (e.g. sick/annual
             leave, absence from work, etc.), while giving up leisure time in the donation
             process. These findings suggest that length of work hours may be negatively
             associated with blood donation status as those who are busier will have less time to
             donate. Moreover, within the subgroups of occasional and regular donors, a higher
             likelihood would be expected within the former than the latter as busy people are
             more likely to lapse in their donation regularity.</p>

          <p>Ethnic backgrounds are often significant predictors of blood donation
             patterns. Boulware et al. (2002) and Burgdorf et al. (2017) assert that in the United
             States (U.S.), African-Americans often exhibit lower propensities to donate blood
             compared to Caucasians. James et al. (2011) attribute this racial difference in the
             willingness to donate to distrust of the health care system in the US among African-
             Americans. In a multi-ethnic donor population like Malaysia, consisting of Malays
             (54.7%), Chinese (24.7%), Indians (7.4%), and various others races (13.2%)
             (Department of Statistics Malaysia, 2008), it is conceivable that ethnic background
             may play an important role in blood donation practices. In fact, Wooi Seong (2017)
             observes that in the past, ethnic Chinese may be apprehensive of donating blood
             due to traditional beliefs that it could result in negative health effects or bad karma
             when visiting hospital blood banks during auspicious periods. Similarly, blood
             banks in Malaysian hospitals often run low during the fasting month of Ramadan
             given the lack of Malay donors who are discouraged from donating for health
             reasons. As such, while ethnic groups are included in the current study to examine
             its possible link with blood donation status, no a priori expectations are held.</p>

          <p>Various studies have pointed to the role of gender as an important catalyst
             to being a blood donor. In these studies, males often exhibit higher likelihoods of
             donating and being frequent donors than females (Volken et al., 2013; Ou et al., 2015).
             Nevertheless, while it is important to recognise that donor frequency should
             be gender adjusted as the maximum number of donations permitted annually
             may be different for adult males (four) and females (three), other reasons may
             account for lower donation rates among women too. According to Veldhuizen
             et al. (2009) and Shenga et al. (2010), females often stop donating much earlier
             in their donor careers than their male counterparts. This is because women are
             disallowed from donating during pregnancy or breastfeeding periods, and thus quit
             donating permanently instead of resuming to donate later. Another possible reason
             accounting for lower donation rates among women include health concerns, such
             as iron-deficiency anaemia or low body weight (Boulware et al., 2002; Kasraian,
             2010). It is therefore posited that males would exhibit higher likelihoods of being
             occasional or regular donors than females in the current study.</p>

          <p>Studies on the role of age on blood donor patterns have generally shown
             mixed outcomes. For instance, Marantidou et al. (2007) note that young people are
             less likely to donate in Greece, while Kasraian (2010), Volken et al. (2013), and
             Ou et al. (2015) report higher response rates among older donors in Iran, Germany,
             and Hong Kong, respectively. Meanwhile, Boulware et al. (2002), Wiwanitkit
             (2002), and Shenga et al. (2010) find no discerning association between age and
             knowledge or actual blood donation in U.S., Thailand, and India, respectively.
              Nonetheless, it is interesting to note the findings of Wooi Seong (2017) that the
              majority of blood donors in Malaysia are predominantly from the younger age
              group of 17â€“35 years. Given the overall mixed outcomes, the association between
              age and blood donor patterns will be further ascertained, albeit with close attention
              on the contribution of the younger donors.</p>

          <p>The role of marital status on blood donation decisions is inconclusive.
             For example, Gillespie and Hillyer (2002) and Veldhuizen et al. (2009) conclude
             that blood donation is most common among married people. Mesch et al. (2011)
             attribute this outcome to the better social network connectivity enjoyed by married
             persons that motivate their donation behaviour to do good to others. Interestingly,
             Burgdorf et al. (2017) stress that while blood donation status is strongly linked with
             cohabitation status among Danish men, the effects are less clear for women. In
             other words, being married serves as a strong positive predictor of blood donation
             only among men, while the association is not as evident for women. Meanwhile,
             Kasraian (2010) and Shenga et al. (2010) find no significant relationship between
             blood donation knowledge and marital status. Thus, the role of marital status on
             blood donation status will be further examined in the current study. </p>

          <p>Studies generally affirm the impact of socioeconomic status (as measured
             by education level or individual income) in affecting blood donation practices,
             although the exact relationships are unclear a priori. For instance, Cimaroli (2012)
             finds that highly educated populations are less likely to donate blood frequently.
             Similarly, Saberton et al. (2009) point to the inverse relationship between average
             household income and donor numbers in large cities. In contrast, Veldhuizen et al.
             (2009) and Carrier, Cloutier and Charbonneau (2015) note that one of the primary
             characteristics of blood donors is the better than average education. Meanwhile,
             findings by Burgdorf et al. (2017) suggest individuals within higher income
             brackets form the majority of the blood donor population, while Veldhuizen
              et al. (2009) and Carrier, Cloutier and Charbonneau (2015) conclude that nonremunerated
              blood donation is typically associated with those in the affluent
              social class. Possible rationalisations for these outcomes vary. It is possible that
              time constraints of a demanding lifestyle among better educated individuals may
              hinder donation frequencies. Likewise, persons with higher income levels may
              also face higher time costs, thus dampening their donation likelihoods. However,
              better educated individuals may also be more conscious of the vital role of blood
              donation while individual affluence may contribute to greater access to health
              information. Based on these outcomes, no hypothesised relationships are posited
              for the socioeconomic variables of education and income in the present study.</p>

          <p>As suggested by Piliavin and Callero (1991), and Glynn et al. (2006), the
          role of life experience (e.g. knowing a family member/friend who needs blood
          transfusion) is positively associated with blood donation decisions. Healy (2000)
          attributes this outcome to "network effects", whereby being associated with family/
          friends with blood needs result in higher donation probabilities by one's own self.
          Two possible explanations are offered. First, individuals with family members/
          friends requiring emergency blood/organ transfusion may have better knowledge
          and familiarity with the donation process. Second, individuals with life experience
          for the need of a valuable resource such as blood are better able to empathise with
          the situation and would thus be more likely to donate to others in return. Therefore,
          a positive association is expected between blood donation status and those with
          family members/friends who received blood/organ transfusion in the past.</p>

          <p>Studies have shown that hemophobia (fear of blood), trypanophobia (fear
          of needles), and even the general fear of the entire donation process are valid
          concerns that may discourage blood donations. Marantidou et al. (2007) assert
          that among the predominant reasons for not returning to donate is due to the
          fear of needles/pain/fainting during the collection process. Meanwhile, Hupfer,
          Taylor, and Letwin (2005) allude to the negative factors of the sight of blood and
          apprehension of the overall blood procurement process as reasons for avoiding
          donation. As such, it is hypothesised that a general fear of the donation process
          would have a negative effect on blood donation status.</p>
